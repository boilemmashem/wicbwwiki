## Homebrew and subsystems

These are the custom rules or systems we have in play.

### Reputation

Our game makes use of the [reputation subsystem](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1234) to keep track of how organisations react to the group.

> Reputation is saved to the group. Unless the whole group perishes new characters being introduced will automatically have this association while acting beside existing party members.
