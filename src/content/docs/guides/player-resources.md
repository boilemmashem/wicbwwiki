## Homebrew and subsystems

These are the custom rules or systems we have in play.

### Reputation

Our game makes use of the [reputation subsystem](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1234) to keep track of how organisations react to the group. Depending on the actions you take, you can gain fame or infamy with factions or locations.

:::tip[Reputation]
Reputation is saved to the group. Unless the whole group perishes, new characters will automatically benefit from the current group rep.
