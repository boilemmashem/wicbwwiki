Sometimes when we get stuck on some rulings they need to be looked up after the game. Here are such things that caught us out in the past.

## Grid Movement diagonals

The first time you Stride diagonal it costs the standard 5ft, the second time it costs a cummulative 5 extra ft. For example while moving diagonally you use 5ft, then 10ft, then 15ft. Moving Three squares diagonally costs 30ft movement total. There's additional rules for difficult terrain outlined in the link above.

If you are using a skill other than Crafting, Lore, or Performance the DC is typically higher. Remember earning income isnt just being god at a task - it's marketing yourself as well. You must be trained in a skill in order to earn income from it.

## Crafting (CRB, p243)
In order to craft an item you need to meet the following requirements:
 - The item is your level or lower
 - You have the formula for the item [Formula prices](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=250)
 - You have an appropriate set of tools
 - You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item's price

You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a crafting check. If you check is successful - you unlock the option to spend additional days to work carefully and reduce the materials you need. The reduction in cost is dependant on your check success / critical success.

Remember there's a basic book of formulas for sale - [Basic Crafter's Book](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=6)
