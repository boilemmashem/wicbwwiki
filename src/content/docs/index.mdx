This is a Wiki for notes about the world and campaign we are running for Pathfinder 2e. Info here is _mostly_ spoiler free for the campaign, and considered to be known by the characters and/or players.

## Let's get to it

	</Card>
	<Card title="Create new pages" icon="add-document">
		Expand existing sections, create characters, or towns.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
