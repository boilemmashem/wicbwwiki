The revered adventurer of old, Avorn Coldforce wielded a mighty hammer infused with the power of ice. He embarked on daring quests, facing formidable foes and protecting his people. One such perilous adventure led Avorn to confront a gargantuan hollow serpent.

Deep within the caverns under the [Venomwood](../Regions/kingsland-north/venomwood.md), the hollow serpent lay coiled, its massive form spanning the underground expanse. Its translucent scales shimmered with an otherworldly glow, concealing it's form. The serpent's mere presence brought darkness and despair to the hearts of all who encountered it.

Armed with Frostfall, Avorn descended into the depths of the caverns. The hammer's icy power radiated, casting a faint glimmer amidst the darkness. A clash of titans ensued as Avorn swung frostfall against the serpentine abomination. The serpent's venomous fangs and thrashing tail tested Avorn's skill and resolve. Each strike of Frostfall sent freezing shockwaves, momentarily disrupting the hollow serpent's ethereal form.

The cavern walls echoed with the clash of ice brutal strength. As the battle raged on, the Hollow Serpent unleashed its devastating shadowy breath, threatening to consume the entire cavern.

The outcome of this epic battle remains shrouded in uncertainty. Some claim that Avorn had struck the decisive blow. Others, however, whispered of a different fate. They suggest that the hollow serpent's grip was too strong and that Avorn had succumbed to the monster. There is little evidence either way to say what happened, but theorists speculate that had the serpent been victorious it would have reared it's head once more.
