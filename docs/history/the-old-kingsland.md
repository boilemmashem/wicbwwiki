The Old Kingsland refers to the [North](../Regions/kingsland-north/kingsland-north.md) and [South](../Regions/kingsland-south/kingsland-south.md) Kingsland before the death of the King. His two sons x and y could not decide on an heir so the kingdom was split with a new border being formed around the mountains.
