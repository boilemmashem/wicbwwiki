Many winters ago this was the recruitment post for the [Kingsland](./../countries/the-kingsland.md), a high price was paid to any settlers able and willing to work in the mines to the north. So many people were recruited here that eventually the town earned it's namesake - Pick's Welcome.

## Pick's Fishery
Owned by [Tammy Tanderveil](#) the fishery has supplied the local area with fish for decades.
