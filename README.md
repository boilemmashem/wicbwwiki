A documentation site to host notes and stories for our home tabletop game.

## ðŸ“š Storytellers welcome

This is a creative space for anyone involved with the game. Have an interesting character idea or story to add? Let's work together to add it! I enjoy creative writing and weaving in threads created from other minds, especially when it can have consequences for the characters involved.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
